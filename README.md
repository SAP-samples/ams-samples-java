# Java Samples for Authorization Management and CAP

This repository contains Java-based sample applications demonstrating **authorization integration** using:

- **Authorization Management Service (AMS)** with Spring Boot and Jakarta EE
- The **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)** with authentication and simple role-based access control

Each sample is self-contained and includes its own setup instructions and deployment configurations for Cloud Foundry and/or Kubernetes.
